Breaking Diffie-Hellman protocol using parameter injection through MITM (Man in the Middle) attack
==================================================================================================

Abstract
--------

The Diffie Hellman public-key protocol, used widely across the world, is susceptible to a 
MITM attack in the absence of authentication. This project aims to develop a secure chat server 
which exchanges keys using Diffie-Hellman and then to develop a MITM attack on it to show  the 
"secure" chat can be intercepted.
